# Chat App
This small git repo follows the ChatApp from [Socket.io Get Started Tutorial](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

By following the tags, you can see my progress solving the Homework given in the basic tutorial

## Homework
[ ] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
[ ] Add support for nicknames
[ ] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
[ ] Add “\{user} is typing” functionality
[ ] Show who’s online
[ ] Add private messaging
